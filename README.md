# fac-hs

This is based on the "Haskell the calculator" section in [wiki.haskell.org](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_in_5_steps),
but with the project provisioned by [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).

## Usage

```console
stack run -- {n}
```

Where n is the number to calculate the factorial for.

Example with multiple numbers:

```console
stack run -- 0 42
```
